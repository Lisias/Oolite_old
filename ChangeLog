Oolite 1.69-test:
* New materials model and more flexibility for shaders.
* Lasers can now be any colour, with the limitation that they must be
  reasonably bright. The new colour spec syntax introduced for lasers is also
  supported for sky colours, but not planets in this release.
* Raised vertex and face counts for meshes, while reducing memory usage.
* Reformatted keyconfig.plist to be more legible and easier to edit.
* Advanced Navigation Array default key changed to ^ (shift-6 on UK keyboards)
  to avoid surprise launches.
* Save/load screens now show more information, and show the correct ship type
  even if it isn’t currently installed (only applies to games saved with 1.69
  or later). Also, a question mark is now shown in place of unknown ships (but
  looks bad due to bugs in setting up smoothed models).
  Under Mac OS X, this only applies in full-screen mode as standard system
  dialogs are used in windowed mode.
* The commander status screen now shows damaged equipment in orange.
* The appearance of interstellar space is now set in planetinfo.plist.
* (Mac OS X only) Support for a new Debug menu added. It is enabled by a
  special OXP, Debug Menu.oxp.
* New debugging key, key_dump_target_state, which dumps a lot of information
  about the player’s target (or the player, if there is no target) to the log.
  Not bound to anything by default.
* New requires.plist key added: max_version. This is not expected to be useful
  very often, except for Debug Menu.oxp. Any unknown keys in required.plist
  will now cause an OXP not to load.
* Improved robustness in various ways, especially with regards to property
  list parsing.
* Various redundant bits of code removed; code cleanup; some optimization.
* Cache is no longer pruned at all. Since it’s rebuilt when OXPs are changed,
  the maximum size of the cache is limited by the installed OXPs. In practice,
  sizes of a few MB can be expected. Under GNUstep, cache read/write should be
  more efficient and the folder the cache lives in will be created if needed.
* Under Mac OS X and Windows, you can force a cache rebuild by holding down
  shift during start-up. This probably sort of works on Linux other systems if
  you press it just at the right moment.
* Fixed various issues under Linux (catching up with changes since pre 1.67).
* (Mac OS X only) Spotlight indexer indexes name of ship for games saved with
  1.69 or later.

Known bugs:
* Several OXP/scripting bugs have been reported and not fixed.
* Greyscale textures with alpha channels are not loaded correctly.
* Some textures still break when swapping between full-screen and windowed
  mode or resizing window (except under Mac OS X).
* Need to analyze memory usage; there seem to be significant leaks.
* equipment_price_factor only affecting station’s sell price not addressed.
* Civilian ships spawning in interstellar space not addressed.
* Ability to scoop more cargo than you have space for under some circumstances
  not addressed.

Oolite 1.68-test:
* Added initial JavaScript support.
* Improvements to shader support:
  - Shaders can be stored in separate files.
  - Shipdata.plist can set uniform variables for shaders.
  - New game-provided uniform, hull_heat_level.
  - Added predefined macros to specify availability of game-provided uniforms.
* This version uses different blending modes for various visual effects.
* Added error reporting for bad property lists.
* Reporting of too-new OXPs fixed.
* Fix for most XML “don’t know how to load entity” errors in custom Linux
  builds.
* port_radius should now work for stations.
* New script query method, systemEconomy_string.
* Improvements to speed and especially smoothness.
* Various minor bug fixes and code clean-ups. 

Oolite 1.67.1-test:
* Advanced Navigation Array can now be purchased (for any ship).
* Yaw control, now with workingness. (Keyboard only. Default keys: ‘,’ and
  ’.’; not available in strict mode.)
* Hopefully fixed crashing bug in streaming sound.
* Increased precision of certain geometric calculations, most noticable in
  laser accuracy.
* Cache is now rebuilt if OXPs are added or removed. Cache is now saved when
  docking rather than when saving.
* (Mac OS X only) Fixed two similar sound glitches.
* (Mac OS X only) Fixed calculation of sound size; sounds larger than 1 MB
  will now be streamed from disk (was 16 MB for stereo and 8 MB for mono).
* Introduced, and hopefully fixed, a bug that made mouse control randomly not
  work.
* (Mac OS X only) Made application about 11 MB smaller.

Oolite 1.67-test:
* GLSL shader support. Now you too can have psychadelic Thargons, assuming
  your hardware supports it.
* another_commander’s Advanced Navigational Array. Activated by ‘!’, replacing
  the Mac-only dump-galactic-chart command (you can find the dumped data on
  the wiki at http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_planet_list).
* Bigger radar blobs for big blobby things.
* Giles’s experimental procedural textures (not dajt’s). Activate by pausing
  (‘P’), then pressing ‘T’. The change will take effect when a new planet
  texture is generated, i.e. it won’t affect the planet in the current system.
  This feature is, er, in need of additional performance optimization.
* Yaw control, possibly. The comments say “keypad 1 and 3”, but those don’t
  work for me (presumably GNUstep/Cocoa differences). Have fun trying to find
  out what does. To do: disable this in strict mode.
* Audio improvements: removed restriction on sound effect size; large sound
  effects are now streamed from disk rather than preloaded. Sound effects are
  now played in stereo.
* New spiffy log filtering system (now with 20% extra spiff). As described
  elswhere (http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=3208).
* Planet rotation speed control (rotation_speed and rotation_speed_factor in
  planetInfo). Default speed has been halved.
* Image placement in HUDs should be consistent across platforms. Presumably
  this will break some HUDs.
* AI changes. Don’t know whether these changes are noticable.
* Possible ghost ship fix.
* Added d256_number and pseudoFixedD256_number.
* Various bug fixes.
