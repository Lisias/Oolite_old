This script creates a PPC dynamic library version of SmartCrashReportsInstall.o. This is needed because SmartCrashReportsInstall.o is built against the 10.4 SDK, but Oolite uses the 10.3 SDK. This is not an issue for i386 (or any future architecture).

A script is used because Xcode's dynamic library template generated spurious errors doing exactly the same thing.
