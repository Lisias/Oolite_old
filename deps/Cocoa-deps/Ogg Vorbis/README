These versions of the Ogg and Vorbis libraries were built from the
libogg-1.1.3 and libvorbis 1.1.2 tarballs, available from
<http://www.xiph.org/>, using the enclosed modified versions of the
XCode projects included in those tarballs.

LibOgg.a contains libogg, built for ppc and i386 architectures.
LibVorbisAll.a contains libvorbis, libvorbisfile and libvorbisenc
built for ppc and i386 architectures.

The ogg and vorbis directories contain header files copied from
the tarballs.
