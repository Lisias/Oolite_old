Playing Oolite
==============

What is it?
-----------
Oolite is a space sim game, written for Mac OS X in Objective C using
Cocoa and OpenGL. It has been ported to Linux and GNUstep.

It was written by Giles Williams in response to the withdrawal of 
Elite - The New Kind from the internet. Although inspired by the work of 
Christian Pinder, following David Braben and Ian Bell, the work is an 
independent interpretation and expansion of the original game.

Oolite is designed as a small game that is easy for users to pick up 
and expand upon. Almost every aspect of the game can be modified using 
simple, free graphics packages and text-editors.

The game and source-code are offered for free under a Creative Commons 
License. One of Giles's priorities for development was to separate the game 
engine from the game materials (graphics, models, AI, text-strings etc.).

How to play it
--------------
If you've not heard of Elite (what rock have you been hiding under since
1984?), Oolite works in pretty much the same way. You trade to make money -
in the meantime fighting off pirates who want to steal your cargo.
To increase your profit (and lessen your chances of dying) you may need
to spend that money on ship upgrades, or perhaps a larger ship.
Or...you may decide to become a pirate yourself! Or you may decide to
be a bounty hunter - picking off the pirates to earn the bounty on their
heads. Your combat rating reflects your skill as a combat pilot - it
goes from Harmess through to Elite.

Watch out if you choose the piracy route - if you get caught by the Police
Vipers, they will show no mercy.

If you're good, you may from time to time get a special mission...

Need more?
==========
So you don't have enough with the basic game?
There are a number of Expansion Packs at the following websites:

http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/OXP
http://capnhack.com/hosting/oolite/Oolite/OoSat.html
http://oosat.alioth.net

To install an OXP, just copy the .oxp folder in the Oolite "AddOns" folder.
Next time you run Oolite, the OXP will be loaded.

If Oolite is installed system-wide then you have the following options:
A. OXPs visible by all users:
        Copy the .oxp folder in the <system-folder>/Oolite/AddOns/
B. OXPs visible only to a user:
        Copy the .oxp folder in the ~/.Oolite/AddOns/

Caution: if you save a game after buying a ship that was in an OXP,
if you subsequently remove the OXP, that commander file will be rendered
useless!
