  close( s )    5/23/2005   Cosme Sevestre <cosme.sevestre@hp.com>
                                    fixed several places where sockets could leak.
                                    these changes were sent in by Jean II for Cosme.
                                    See http.c for mods. 

  http_request
                4/2/2003    Jean II all requests are not limited to an 8k URL,
                                    mainly because if you need to send more than
                                    8k, you will need to use a post. More so, you
                                    must use a POST if you want to send more than
                                    8k, GET will not work. There is now a new struct
                                    to pass the extra header info, post data, and
                                    the length of the post data, and this will now
                                    allow for binary data to be transfered without
                                    having to UUENCODE it.
                                    
                                    NOTE:   this breaks the API on previous versions,
                                            but it will only be calls to http_request
                                            which previously used entities, which are
                                            mostly a small percentage of cases. New
                                            struct is HTTP_Extra.
 
    LIBHTTP_VERSION
                3/27/2003   ajd     add in a version to be used in the User-Agent
                                    entity of the header for requests.
                                    
    parse_url   3/27/2003   jjsa    Sarton Jean-Jacques <jean-jacques.sarton@siemens.com>
                                    change return type to NULL rather than (char *)"", so
                                    it won't get free'd in http_request.
    
    http_request3/27/2003   jjsa    Sarton Jean-Jacques <jean-jacques.sarton@siemens.com>
                                    error info added if can't calloc for pBuf, account for
                                    NULL return from parse_url, use strdup() instead of
                                    assigning in_URL to path, remove realloc when size
                                    doesn't change
                                    
    do_file     3/27/2003   jjsa    Sarton Jean-Jacques <jean-jacques.sarton@siemens.com>
                                    add error info
 
    HFLAG_FORCE_NO_PROXY
                3/5/2003    Jean II Jean Tourrilhes <jt@hpl.hp.com>
                                    added flag to force a no use of the proxy,
                                    which is handy if you're inside of a firewall
                                    and have a server inside you don't need to
                                    use the firewall to access.
 
    http_request()
                10/13/2002  ajd     parse_url previously allocated the working
                                    on the stack, and this was a problem seen
                                    by the path becoming corrupted upon a call
                                    to gethostbyname(). data is allocated inside
                                    parse_url and free'd in http_request().
                                    Thanks to Erick Briere and JacoboQ for
                                    pointing that out! libhttp-0.6
 
    parse_url   10/13/2002  ajd     fix bug inside parse_url where the url
                                    sent into the function from a POST could
                                    be longer than 8k, but turl was allocated
                                    on the stack and was of an 8k size. This
                                    was pointed out by  Erick Briere. Thanks!

    http_proxy  5/14/2002   Jean II Jean Tourrilhes <jt@hpl.hp.com>
                                    add proxy changes. these changes appear
                                    to override the changes from jjsa below,
                                    and I'll need to test and validate this to
                                    make sure it works, hopefully for both
                                    cases.

    http_request()
                5/13/2002   Jean II Jean Tourrilhes <jt@hpl.hp.com>
                                    add compile time options, allowing sections
                                    of the library to be optional. Defines in
                                    http.h.
                                    add bitfield to http_request to allow flags,
                                    currently to return header info.
                                    add ability to specifiy "Content-Type:" on
                                    post.
                                    add ability to return headers to caller
                                    add helper function to parse HTTP header
                                    
    NOTE:   many thanks to to Jean II for not just this patch, but for the countless
            hours that his Wireless Lan resource for Linux webpage has saved *ME*!
            Thanks ever so much!

    http_proxy  2/17/2002   jjsa    Sarton Jean-Jacques <jean-jacques.sarton@siemens.com>
                                    sent in a patch when a proxy is passed, libhttp
                                    was not storing the url into the path before
                                    making the call. This is being added into 0.3 

    do_file     2/17/2002   crh     Chris Hawks <chrish@syscon-intl.com> sent in
                                    a patch for adding a local html file for a
                                    device, as well as some patches for POST.
                                    Thanks a bunch! This was added to 0.2, but
                                    I fogot to add a comment.
