OOFilteringEnumerator.h
By Jens Ayton

NSEnumerator which takes an existing enumerator and filters out the objects
that return NO from a given method. The method may take 0 or 1 arguments

Example of use:
	NSArray			*cats = [self cats];
	NSEnumerator	*happyCatEnum = [[cats objectEnumerator] filteredWithSelector:@selector(isHappy)];
	id				happyCat = nil;
	
	while ((happyCat = [happyCatEnum nextObject]))
	{
		...
	}

Filters can be trivially chained. For instance, to get happy red cats, use:
	NSEnumeratore	*happyRedCatEnum = [[[cats objectEnumerator]
										filteredWithSelector:@selector(isHappy)]
										filteredWithSelector:@selector(hasColor:)
												 andArgument:[NSColor redColor]];

Objects that do not respond to the filter selector are treated as if they had
returned NO.

Bonus feature: adds NSArray-like (but non-exception-throwing)
makeObjectsPerformSelector: to all enumerators.
