OOMaterial.h

A material which can be applied to an OpenGL object, or more accurately, to
the current OpenGL render state.

This is an abstract class; actual materials should be subclasses.

Currently, only shader materials are supported. Direct use of textures should
also be replaced with an OOMaterial subclass.
