/*	OOExtractPixMapChannel()
	Given a 4-channel pixmap, extract one channel, producing a single-channel
	pixmap. This is done in place, destroying the original data.
	ChannelIndex specifies which component to extract. This is a per-pixel
	byte index: 0 means bytes bytes 0, 4, 8 etc. will be used, 2 means bytes
	2, 6, 10 etc. will be used.
	Returns false (without modifying the pixmap) if passed NULL, an invalid
	pixmap, a pixmap whose channel count is not 4, or a channel index greater
	than 3.

/*	OOPixMapToRGBA()
	Convert a pixmap to RGBA format. If it has one component, it is assumed to
	be greyscale. If it has two components, it is assumed to be greyscale+alpha.
	If it has four components, it is left as-is.
	NOTE: if successful, this will free() the original buffer and replace it.
*/

/*	OOPixMapModulateUniform()
	Multiply all pixels by specified per-component factors. Pixmap must have
	four components. The effect of using factors outside the range [0..1] is
	undefined.
	OOPixMapToRGBA() is called on ioPixMap.
