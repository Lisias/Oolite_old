	Configuration should be a dictionary equivalent to an entry in a
	shipdata.plist "shaders" dictionary. Specifically, keys OOShaderMaterial
	will look for are currently:
		textures			array of texture file names.
		vertex_shader		name of vertex shader file.
		glsl-vertex			vertex shader source (if no vertex_shader).
		fragment_shader		name of fragment shader file.
		glsl-fragment		fragment shader source (if no fragment_shader).
		glsl				fragment shader source (if no glsl-fragment).
		uniforms			dictionary of uniforms. Values are either reals or
							dictionaries containing:
			type			"int", "texture" or "float"
			value			number
	
	Macros is a dictionary which is converted to macro definitions and
	prepended to shader source code. It should be used to specify the
	availability if uniforms you tend to register, and other macros such as
	bug fix identifiers. For example, the
	dictionary:
		{ "OO_ENGINE_LEVEL" = 1; }
	
	will be transformed into:
		#define OO_ENGINE_LEVEL 1

	SelectorName should specify a method of source which returns the desired
	value; it will be called every time -apply is, assuming uniformName is
	used in the shader. (If not, OOShaderMaterial will not track the binding.)
	
	A bound method must not take any parameters, and must return one of the
	following types:
		* Any integer or float type.
		* NSNumber.
		* Vector.
		* Quaternion.
		* Matrix.
		* OOColor.
	
	The "convert" flag has different meanings for different types:
		* For int, float or NSNumber, it clamps to the range [0..1].
		* For Vector, it normalizes.
		* For Quaternion, it converts to a rotation matrix (instead of a vector).
