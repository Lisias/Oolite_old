	If kOOTextureAllowRectTexture is set, and GL_EXT_texture_rectangle is
	available, textures whose dimensions are not powers of two will be loaded
	as rectangle textures. Rectangle textures use unnormalized co-ordinates;
	that is, co-oridinates range from 0 to the actual size of the texture
	rather than 0 to 1. Thus, for rectangle textures, -texCoordsScale returns
	-dimensions (with the required wait for loading) for a rectangle texture.
	For non-rectangle textures, (1, 1) is returned without delay. If the
	texture has power-of-two dimensions, it will be loaded as a normal
	texture.
	
	Rectangle textures have additional limitations: kOOTextureMinFilterMipMap
	is not supported (kOOTextureMinFilterLinear will be used instead), and
	kOOTextureRepeatS/kOOTextureRepeatT will be ignored. 
	
	Note that 'rectangle texture' is a misnomer; non-rectangle textures may
	be rectangular, as long as their sides are powers of two. Non-power-of-two
	textures would be more descriptive, but this phrase is used for the
	extension that allows 'normal' textures to have non-power-of-two sides
	without additional restrictions. It is intended that OOTexture should
	support this in future, but this shouldnâ€™t affect the interface, only
	avoid the scaling-to-power-of-two stage.
