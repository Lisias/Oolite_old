/*	The aspect ratio of the screen, or buest guesstimate, based on aspect
	ratio of largest non-stretched mode. Used to calculate pixel aspect ratios
	for modes.
	
	Note: 4:3 CRTs tend to have non-4:3 modes like 1152x870 (192:145). However,
	these can typically be adjusted to squarish pixel ratio with screen
	controls, so may or may not be stretched. The OS reports these as non-
	stretched, so we report an aspect ratio of 1.0.
