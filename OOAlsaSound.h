// OOALSASound.h: Interface for oolite to the Advanced Linux Sound
// Achitecture.
// Implements methods from NSSound which are used by oolite.
//
// It is a bit of a stopgap measure since the base NSSound is fine,
// well, except the gnustep_sndd (sound daemon) crashes each time
// it plays a sound, and it probably uses OSS instead of ALSA.
// We also don't want a dependency on gnustep_sndd for statically-linked
// versions of oolite.
