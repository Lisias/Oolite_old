/*
	Per-GPU type settings.
	
	Supported settings:
		default_shader_level	Shader level used if user hasn't made a choice.
								Default: "SHADERS_FULL". Possible values:
								"SHADERS_OFF", "SHADERS_SIMPLE", "SHADERS_FULL".
		maximum_shader_level	Maximum permitted shader level. Same values as
								above. Default: "SHADERS_FULL". If set to
								"SHADERS_OFF", shaders are treated as not
								available.
		smooth_points			Enable or disable use of point smoothing.
								Default: on.
		smooth_lines			Enable or disable use of line smoothing.
								Default: on.
	
	Matching dictionaries:
		"match" dictionaries contain regular expressions tested against any of
		"vendor", "renderer", "version" and "extensions". These are displayed
		near the top of the log by default. Note that "version" here refers to
		the full version string (shown in parentheses). The "extension" string
		used for matches is space-separated (no commas as in the log), and
		extension strings may occur in any order.
		Multiple regexps may be specified as an array, in which case all must
		match.
		Any backslashes in regexps must be escaped (i.e., doubled); see the
		"renderer" test for Intel GMA 9xx for an example.
