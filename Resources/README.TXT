oolite-data
===========

This contains all the data that oolite needs when you run it - sounds,
textures etc. It is distributed separately to the source since
the source is changing MUCH more frequently than the data, and it makes
for massive source downloads if the data is included.

Unpack this directory in your oolite source dir before you build.
