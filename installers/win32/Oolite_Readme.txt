-----------------

A folder has been created in Start -> Program Files called Oolite. This
folder has icons for running the game, the reference sheet, this file,
and an uninstall program.

To run the game, choose the Oolite icon in the Oolite folder.


Switching between full screen and windowed mode, or changing resolution
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This should work significantly better than in previous versions of Oolite
for Windows.

There are still some problems with models and their textures, but for the
most part all the textures get reinitialised and keep working.

The file <installation dir>/oolite.app/GNUstep/Defaults/.GNUstepDefaults
contains the current settings for fullscreen mode and display resolutions.

If in doubt, delete this file and restart the game. That will start you
in windowed mode.

Do not try to resize the window in windowed mode. The settings are not
saved under Windows and the game will restart in an 800x600 widow.

To change the full screen mode resolution, change the display_width and
display_height values, and ensure the fullscreen property has a value of
<*BY>.

These settings will give a full screen display of 800x600:

{
    NSGlobalDomain = {
    };
    oolite.exe = {
    display_width = <*I800>;
    display_height = <*I600>;
	fullscreen = <*BY>;
	volume_control = <*R1>;
    };
}

And these settings will give a full screen display of 1400x1050:

{
    NSGlobalDomain = {
    };
    oolite.exe = {
    display_width = <*I1400>;
    display_height = <*I1050>;
	fullscreen = <*BY>;
	volume_control = <*R1>;
    };
}
