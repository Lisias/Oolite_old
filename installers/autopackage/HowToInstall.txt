.package Installation Instructions
----------------------------------
Start by uninstalling any Oolite (repository installation).
If you have already installed Oolite from a .package, it 
will be automatically uninstalled without affecting any of 
your save-games or add-ons.

Then execute the following:
(replace <package_name> with the actual name of the 
.package file - without the '<' and '>' characters)
	$ chmod u+x <package_name>.package
	$ ./<package_name>.package

Accept the download of the autopackage runtime and 
the GTK (needed only once). You will be prompted for 
a password with root privileges. If you don't provide it, 
the installation will be visible only to your user.

To remove oolite execute
(as root if you provided a password during installation)
	$ package remove oolite

Following the installation you may start Oolite from 
Games/Oolite menu or by executing:
	$ oolite
from a terminal.



Documentation
-------------
Oolite documentation can be found in
(if password was not provided during installation)
~/.local/lib/Oolite/doc/
or
(if password was provided during installation)
/usr/lib/Oolite/doc/
Feel free to also visit the Oolite wiki http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_Main_Page



Oolite Expansion Packs (i.e. add-ons)
-------------------------------------
Create the AddOns folder:
   $ mkdir ~/.Oolite/AddOns/
and copy the add-on ".oxp" folder into ~/.Oolite/AddOns/



Oolite Paths
------------
Note: The root-path for Oolite installation is either
~/.local (if password was not provided during installation)
or
/usr (if password was provided during installation)

During the .package installation Oolite will create the following:
<root-path>/lib/Oolite/ (application folder for binaries, resources and documentation)
<root-path>/bin/oolite (this is what you execute to run Oolite)
<root-path>/bin/oolite-update (this is what you execute to update oolite)

Following the first run, Oolite will create:
~/.Oolite/ (logs and add-ons)
~/.Oolite/Logs/ (Latest.log and Previous.log text-files)
~/GNUstep/ (GNUstep defaults and caches)
~/oolite-saves/ (save-games and screenshots)

Following the first in-game screenshot taken (using the "*" key):
~/oolite-saves/snapshots/
will be created to store the in-game screenshot
